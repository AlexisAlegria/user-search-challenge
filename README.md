# Getting Started with User Search React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features :white_check_mark:

The app is about searching users from a public API [https://randomuser.me/api/?results=15](https://randomuser.me/api/?results=15).

Each user was shown on screen by Cards, and each one contains relevant information about the user e.g First Name, Last Name, Email, Cell Number, City and Country

You can search users based on three criterias:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Country
